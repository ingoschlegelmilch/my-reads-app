# MyReads Project

MyReads book app, which manages you book shelves.
You can search books via the API provided by [Udacity](https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com).

You can add books to your `want to read` reading list, mark books as `read` or `currently reading`.
You can remove books from a shelf by moving it to the `none` shelf.

# Persistence

We assume a token is set in `localstorage` to retrieve personalised book shelves.
This could be added later through an authentication process.

# Installation

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
